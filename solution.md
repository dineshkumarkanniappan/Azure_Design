**Application Architecture:**
1. Microservice Architecture:

    + Config Servers: Centralized configuration management.
    + Gateway Servers: Routing and API management.
    + Service Discovery Servers: Registration and lookup of services.
2. Logging Management:

    + Centralized Logging Service: Aggregation and analysis of application logs.
    + Log Storage: Storage for logs with appropriate retention policies.

**DevSecOps Tools:**
1. CI (Continuous Integration):

    + Tool (e.g., Azure DevOps, Jenkins): Automate builds and tests on code commits.
    + Unit Tests, Integration Tests: Part of CI pipelines for quality checks.

2. Code Quality:

    + Static Code Analysis Tools + (e.g., SonarQube): 
    Identify and fix code quality issues.
    + Code Review Processes: Incorporate peer reviews in CI pipelines.

3. Artifacts Server:

    + Artifact Repository (e.g., Azure Artifacts, Nexus): 
Store build artifacts and dependencies.

4. Security Check:

    +  Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Scanning for vulnerabilities.
    + Dependency Scanning: Identifying and patching vulnerable dependencies.
5. CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment):

    + Deployment Orchestration (e.g., Azure Pipelines, GitLab CI/CD): Automated deployment pipelines.
    + Manual Approval Gates: Ensuring controlled releases in the deployment process.
