**Subscriptions:**

Multiple subscriptions can be created based on the needs for isolation, billing, and resource separation. For instance:

+ Connectivity Subscription: Contains networking resources like virtual networks, gateways, etc.

+ Application Subscriptions: Used for hosting applications and services, including the Managed Kubernetes cluster.

**Networking:**
Networking components are crucial for establishing connectivity between various resources. In Azure, this typically includes:

+ Virtual Network (VNET): Segmented networking environment to host resources. It could be configured with subnets for different purposes (e.g., backend, frontend, Kubernetes pods).

+ Gateway/Subnet: To connect on-premises resources or provide connectivity to the internet.

+ Load Balancers: For distributing traffic to Kubernetes nodes and other services.

**Managed Kubernetes (AKS):**
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will be utilized for the managed Kubernetes solution:

+ AKS Cluster: Managed Kubernetes cluster for hosting containerized applications.

+ Node Pools: Different node pools for specific workloads or resource requirements.

**Deployment Architecture:**
+ Application Workloads: Deployed and managed within the AKS Cluster.

+ Storage Services: Utilize Azure Storage for persistent storage needs of the applications.

+ Monitoring & Logging: Incorporate Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics for performance monitoring and logging.

**Security & Identity:**

+ Azure Active Directory Integration: Enables identity and access management for resources.

+ Network Security Groups (NSGs): Controls inbound and outbound traffic to the resources within the VNET.

+ Azure Key Vault: For securely storing and managing sensitive information like secrets, keys, and certificates.

+ Azure Security Center: Monitors and enhances the security posture of the environment.

This is a high-level overview of the Azure cloud infrastructure design for Managed Kubernetes and associated resources.
