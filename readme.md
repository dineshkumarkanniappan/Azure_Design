# Azure Cloud Infrastructure Design #

**Landing Zone:**

The landing zone represents the initial environment setup where all resources will be deployed. In Azure, this is often organized using the following components:

+ Tenant: Azure Active Directory (AAD) Tenant - Represents your organization's identity and access management.

+ Management Group: Organizational structure for managing Azure resources. It helps in applying policies and governance across subscriptions.

**Subscriptions:**

Multiple subscriptions can be created based on the needs for isolation, billing, and resource separation. For instance:

+ Connectivity Subscription: Contains networking resources like virtual networks, gateways, etc.

+ Application Subscriptions: Used for hosting applications and services, including the Managed Kubernetes cluster.

**Networking:**
Networking components are crucial for establishing connectivity between various resources. In Azure, this typically includes:

+ Virtual Network (VNET): Segmented networking environment to host resources. It could be configured with subnets for different purposes (e.g., backend, frontend, Kubernetes pods).

+ Gateway/Subnet: To connect on-premises resources or provide connectivity to the internet.

+ Load Balancers: For distributing traffic to Kubernetes nodes and other services.

**Managed Kubernetes (AKS):**
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will be utilized for the managed Kubernetes solution:

+ AKS Cluster: Managed Kubernetes cluster for hosting containerized applications.

+ Node Pools: Different node pools for specific workloads or resource requirements.

**Deployment Architecture:**
+ Application Workloads: Deployed and managed within the AKS Cluster.

+ Storage Services: Utilize Azure Storage for persistent storage needs of the applications.

+ Monitoring & Logging: Incorporate Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics for performance monitoring and logging.

**Security & Identity:**

+ Azure Active Directory Integration: Enables identity and access management for resources.

+ Network Security Groups (NSGs): Controls inbound and outbound traffic to the resources within the VNET.

+ Azure Key Vault: For securely storing and managing sensitive information like secrets, keys, and certificates.

+ Azure Security Center: Monitors and enhances the security posture of the environment.

This is a high-level overview of the Azure cloud infrastructure design for Managed Kubernetes and associated resources.

**Application Architecture:**
**Microservice Architecture:**
+ Components:
    + Config Server:
Centralized configuration management using tools like Spring Cloud Config.

+ Gateway:
    + API Gateway for routing and managing access to microservices (e.g., Netflix Zuul, Spring Cloud Gateway).

    + Service Discovery Servers:
Utilizing tools like Netflix Eureka or Consul for service registration and discovery.

**Application Log Management:**

+ Logging Infrastructure:
    + Centralized logging utilizing ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Azure-native solutions like Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.

**DevSecOps Tools:**
+ Container Security:
    + Trivy:
        + Open-source vulnerability scanner for container images.
    + Docker Scout:
        + Helps in identifying security issues in Docker containers.
    + Container Registry Security:
+ ACR Defender:
    + Azure Container Registry's integrated scanning and security features.
+ Aqua:
    + Provides container security for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

**Continuous Integration (CI):**
+ Azure DevOps:
    + Integrated CI/CD tool offering pipelines for building, testing, and deploying applications.

**Code Quality & Static Analysis:**
+ SonarQube:
    + Performs static code analysis to enhance code quality.
+ Checkmarx:
Application security testing for identifying vulnerabilities in the code.
    + Artifact Management:

+ Azure Artifacts:
    + Repository to store and manage application artifacts, dependencies, and packages.
**Security Checks & Compliance:**
+ Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark:
    + Offers best practices and guidelines for securing Azure resources.
+   Security Control Baseline:
    + Implements security controls and compliance standards specific to Azure.

**Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):**
**Deployment Tools:**
+ Azure DevOps: 
    + Handles both CI and CD pipelines.

+ Helm & ArgoCD: 
    + Used for managing Kubernetes application deployments, especially Helm charts and GitOps-based deployments through ArgoCD.

This architecture ensures a robust, scalable, and secure microservices-based application deployment within Azure's cloud infrastructure. It integrates various DevSecOps tools for continuous monitoring, security checks, and efficient deployment processes. Each tool contributes to different phases of the software development lifecycle, aiming to ensure quality, security, and compliance.
