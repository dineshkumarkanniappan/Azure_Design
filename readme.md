# Azure Solution Design & Architecture

**Create an infra, network, and deployment design diagram to set up new cloud infrastructure in any cloud provider Azure/GCP.**

* *Includes (the design should start from a tenant if Azure, a project if GCP) other resources* *

    - Landing zone
    - Management Group
    - VNET
    - Connectivity Subscription / Other Subscriptions
    - Design should support Managed Kubernetes (with production ready)
 
Application Architecture

   - Microservice architecture
   - With all key components (config, gateway, and service discovery servers)
   - Application log management
 

DevSecOps Tools (any tools based on working experience)
  +  CI (Continuous Integration)
  +  Code quality
  +  Artifacts Server
  +  Security Check  
  +  CD (Continuous delivery/deployment)

**Application Architecture:**
**Microservice Architecture:**
+ Components:
    + Config Server:
Centralized configuration management using tools like Spring Cloud Config.

+ Gateway:
    + API Gateway for routing and managing access to microservices (e.g., Netflix Zuul, Spring Cloud Gateway).

    + Service Discovery Servers:
Utilizing tools like Netflix Eureka or Consul for service registration and discovery.

**Application Log Management:**

+ Logging Infrastructure:
    + Centralized logging utilizing ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Azure-native solutions like Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.

**DevSecOps Tools:**
+ Container Security:
    + Trivy:
        + Open-source vulnerability scanner for container images.
    + Container Registry Security:
+ ACR Defender:
    + Azure Container Registry's integrated scanning and security features.
+ Aqua:
    + Provides container security for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

**Continuous Integration (CI):**
+ Azure DevOps:
    + Integrated CI/CD tool offering pipelines for building, testing, and deploying applications.

**Code Quality & Static Analysis:**
+ SonarQube:
    + Performs static code analysis to enhance code quality.
+ Checkmarx:
Application security testing for identifying vulnerabilities in the code.
    + Artifact Management:

+ Azure Artifacts:
    + Repository to store and manage application artifacts, dependencies, and packages.
**Security Checks & Compliance:**
+ Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark:
    + Offers best practices and guidelines for securing Azure resources.
+   Security Control Baseline:
    + Implements security controls and compliance standards specific to Azure.

**Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):**
**Deployment Tools:**
+ Azure DevOps: 
    + Handles both CI and CD pipelines.

+ Helm & ArgoCD: 
    + Used for managing Kubernetes application deployments, especially Helm charts and GitOps-based deployments through ArgoCD.

This architecture ensures a robust, scalable, and secure microservices-based application deployment within Azure's cloud infrastructure. It integrates various DevSecOps tools for continuous monitoring, security checks, and efficient deployment processes. Each tool contributes to different phases of the software development lifecycle, aiming to ensure quality, security, and compliance.
